**Captionify: Image-to-Text Conversion using CNN and LSTM**
Captionify is a deep learning project that aims to generate textual captions for images. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from images and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating descriptive captions. This project can be useful in various applications such as automatic image captioning, aiding visually impaired individuals, and enhancing image search functionality.

Features
Extracts features from images using pre-trained CNN models.
Generates descriptive captions for images using LSTM networks.
Customizable architecture to experiment with different CNN and LSTM configurations.
Supports training on custom datasets for specific domains or use cases.
Easy-to-use interface for image captioning tasks.
